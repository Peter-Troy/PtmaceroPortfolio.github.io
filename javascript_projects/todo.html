							</div>
							<span class="image main"><img src="todo-image/todolistpic.jpg"  width="300" height="250" alt="" /></span>
							<p>I created an HTML file with the necessary elements for the app. It includes a task input field, an "Add" button, a task list, and a dropdown menu for task status. I also linked a CSS file (style.css) to style the app's appearance and a JavaScript file (app.js) to handle its functionality.</p>
							<div style="text-align: center;"> <span><img src="todo-image/1.png"  width="600" height="400"  style="border-radius: 2%;" alt=""  /></span> </div>
							<br>
							<p>In the JavaScript file, I implemented the addTask() function. This function creates a new task item and appends it to the task list when the "Add" button is clicked. Additionally, I added a sound effect to play (insert.mp3) using the playinsertsound() function whenever a task is added.</p>
							<div style="text-align: center;"> <span><img src="todo-image/addtask.png"  width="600" height="500"  style="border-radius: 2%;" alt=""  /></span> </div>
							<br>
							<p>To ensure that the task data is saved, I implemented the saveTaskData() function. This function stores the task data in local storage, using a unique ID (taskId) for each task item. The ID is generated using the Date.now().toString() method.</p>
							<div style="text-align: center;"> <span><img src="todo-image/savetask.png"  width="600" height="300"  style="border-radius: 2%;" alt=""  /></span> </div>
							<br>
							<p>On page load, I populate the task list by retrieving the task data from local storage and dynamically creating task items using the populateTaskList() function.</p>
							<div style="text-align: center;"> <span><img src="todo-image/populatetask.png"  width="600" height="300"  style="border-radius: 2%;" alt=""  /></span> </div>
							<br>
							<p>For task deletion, I implemented the deleteTask() function. When the "Delete" button is clicked, it removes the corresponding task item from the task list. I added a sound effect (delete.mp3) to play when a task is deleted using the playdeletesound() function.</p>
							<br>
							<div style="text-align: center;"> <span><img src="todo-image/deletetask.png"  width="600" height="300"  style="border-radius: 2%;" alt=""  /></span> </div>
							<br>
							<p>To handle changes in task status, I created the handleDropdownChange() function. When a different option is selected from the dropdown menu, it updates the task's status accordingly. If the option is "Completed," the task item is marked as completed by adding the "completed" class. If it's "In Progress," the "completed" class is removed. If it's "Deleted," the task item is removed from the list, and the task data is deleted from local storage. I included sound effects (complete.mp3 and inprogress.mp3) that play when a task's status is changed using the playcompletesound() and playinprogresssound() functions, respectively.</p>
							<div style="text-align: center;"> <span><img src="todo-image/handledropdown.png"  width="600" height="500"  style="border-radius: 2%;" alt=""  /></span> </div>
							<br>
							<p>To ensure task data updates, I implemented the updateTaskData() function. It updates the task data in local storage when a task's status is changed.</p>
							<div style="text-align: center;"> <span><img src="todo-image/updatetask.png"  width="600" height="300"  style="border-radius: 2%;" alt=""  /></span> </div>
							<br>
							<p>For removing task data, I created the removeTaskData() function. When a task is deleted, it removes the task data from local storage.</p>
							<div style="text-align: center;"> <span><img src="todo-image/removetask.png"  width="600" height="300"  style="border-radius: 2%;" alt=""  /></span> </div>
							<br>
							<p>Finally, I added sound effects by creating instances of the Audio object for each sound effect (audioinsert, audiocomplete, audiodelete) and specifying the corresponding sound file paths. The sound effects are played using the playinsertsound(), playcompletesound(), and playdeletesound() functions, respectively.</p>
							<div style="text-align: center;"> <span><img src="todo-image/playsound.png"  width="300" height="300"  style="border-radius: 2%;" alt=""  /></span> </div>
							<br>
							<p>Project Structure:</p>

							<br>
							<p>During the development of my "Todo list" app, I encountered several challenges that required problem-solving and perseverance. Here are some of the hurdles I faced:</p>
							<p>Implementing audio playback was quite a challenge. I wanted to add sound effects for actions like adding a task, completing a task, and deleting a task. However, figuring out how to correctly play the audio files when each action occurred proved to be more difficult than anticipated. I had to experiment with different audio playback techniques and ensure that the appropriate sound played for each specific action.</p>
							<p>Handling task status changes was another obstacle I had to overcome. I decided to use a dropdown menu to allow users to change the status of a task, such as marking it as "in progress," "completed," or "deleted." However, initially, I struggled to update the task item's appearance and behavior based on the selected status. It took some careful debugging and adjustments to properly reflect the chosen status for each task.</p>
							<p>Managing the task data in local storage was a significant challenge. I wanted the app to save the tasks locally so that they would persist even after a page refresh. However, efficiently storing and retrieving the task data, updating it when the status changed, and removing tasks from local storage when deleted required meticulous handling. I had to carefully synchronize the task data with the user interface to ensure data consistency and a seamless user experience.</p>
							<p>Validating user input posed its own set of challenges. I wanted to prevent users from adding empty tasks, so I needed to implement proper input validation. However, finding the most effective way to check for empty input and displaying an alert to prompt the user to enter a valid task proved to be trickier than expected. I had to carefully validate the input and handle the alert display in a user-friendly manner.</p>
							<p>Dynamically creating tasks was a hurdle I had to overcome. I wanted to allow users to add tasks dynamically, which required creating HTML elements on the fly. Assigning unique identifiers to each task, properly appending them to the task list, and maintaining the overall structure of the app demanded careful attention to detail and a deep understanding of DOM manipulation.</p>
							<p>These challenges pushed me to think critically, research different techniques, and experiment with various solutions. By documenting these hurdles and the strategies I employed to overcome them, I hope to provide valuable insights to others facing similar challenges while developing their own task management applications.</p>
